Requirements for the Car Parking Lot (CPL) System:

Vehicle Type Support: The system should accommodate different vehicle types (initially cars and motorcycles).
Tiered Pricing: Parking charges should be tiered based on vehicle type and parking duration (hourly rates, daily maximum, multiple-day rates, potentially an initial fixed rate).
Multiple Levels: The parking lot has multiple floors to maximize capacity.
Multiple Entrances: The parking lot has several entry points.
Proximity-Based Allocation (Desired): The system should ideally allocate parking spots that are nearest to the vehicle's entry point, if possible.
Payment on Exit: Drivers will pay for their parking upon exiting the facility.
Multiple Payment Options: The system should support various payment methods.
Real-time Display: Display boards at entrances and potentially on each level should show the number of occupied and available parking spots.
Floor Capacity Management: Each floor has a maximum capacity for parking. The display boards should indicate if a floor or the entire parking lot is full.
